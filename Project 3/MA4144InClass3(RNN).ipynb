    "**Answer** \n",
    "\n",
    "The practical reasons for using words longer than 3 letters and with maximum length limitations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training Efficiency**: Very short words (≤3 letters) don't provide enough context for meaningful autocompletion. For example, \"cat\" or \"dog\" are already complete and don't need autocompletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory and Computational Constraints**: Very long words require more memory and computational resources. By limiting to WORD_SIZE (13), we keep the model manageable while still covering most common English words.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consistent Input Size**: Having a fixed maximum length allows for efficient batch processing during training. All words are padded to the same length, making tensor operations faster and more straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Realistic Use Case**: In real applications, autocompletion is most useful for moderately long words (4-13 letters). Users typically don't need help with very short words, and extremely long words are rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach will help build a better model because:\n",
    "- It focuses on the most relevant use cases for autocompletion\n",
    "- Reduces noise from trivial cases (very short words)\n",
    "- Enables efficient batch training with uniform input sizes\n",
    "- Balances model complexity with practical utility"

    "\n",
    "PROBLEMS WITH ORDINAL ENCODING OF LETTERS:\n",
    "1. Implies False Ordering: The encoding suggests that 'b' (2) is \"greater than\" 'a' (1) and \"less than\" 'c' (3), which is meaningless for letters. Letters don't have a natural numerical relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Artificial Distance Relationships: The model might incorrectly learn that 'a' and 'b' are \"closer\" than 'a' and 'z', when in reality all letters should be treated as equally different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Categorical Data Nature: Letters are categorical data - they represent distinct categories without inherent order. Categorical data should typically be encoded using one-hot encoding or similar methods that don't impose false relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "EMBEDDING LAYERS - THE SOLUTION:\n",
    "An embedding layer is a learnable lookup table that maps discrete tokens (like our character numbers 0-26) to dense vector representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "PURPOSE OF EMBEDDING LAYERS:\n",
    "1. Learned Representations: Instead of using arbitrary numbers, the model learns meaningful vector representations for each character during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dense Vectors: Each character gets represented as a dense vector (e.g., 50-dimensional) rather than a sparse one-hot vector or meaningless integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Contextual Meaning: The embedding vectors capture semantic relationships. Characters that often appear in similar contexts will have similar embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Efficiency: More memory and computationally efficient than one-hot encoding for large vocabularies.\n",
